                    NetBeans besomes an Apache project. Currently, NetBeans 9.0 Beta (incubating) constitutes all the modules in the 
                    Apache NetBeans Git repo, which together provide the NetBeans Platform (i.e., the underlying application framework), 
                    which was released as Apache NetBeans 9.0 Alpha (incubating), as well as all the modules that provide the Java SE-related 
                    features of Apache NetBeans. <br/><br/> In short, Apache NetBeans 9.0 Beta (incubating) is a full IDE for Java SE development. 
                    See the below for the donation status of features that have not been donated to Apache yet, e.g., features for working 
                    with Java EE, JavaScript, PHP, C/C++, and more: <a href="https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/NETBEANS/Apache+Transition">Apache Wiki </a>.
                    <p><i>Note:</i> As beta version it provides a good impression. Nevertheless, it is not completely stable.</p>
